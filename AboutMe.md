In my free time, I enjoy working on my 1989 Dodge Dakota, which I recently rebuilt the engine of. I also like to shoot guns (I personally own 5 firearms). On top of that, I enjoy rebuilding my old childhood lego sets. My favorite hobby to do, however, is relax and play video games like [Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com/home), [Star Wars Battlefront II](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2), etc.
